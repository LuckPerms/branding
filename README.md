## Logo

The original LuckPerms logo was designed by Coolkish in 2016. It was altered slightly and re-drawn as a vector graphic in 2020.

* The logo is available in either the SVG or PNG format. Prefer using the SVG version when possible. (it's a smaller file but the best quality!)
* Please consider using the permalink when embedding the image instead of rehosting it yourself.
